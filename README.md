# BooHub
BooHub is a one-stop application for all your Halloween needs, built with Streamlit. It provides a variety of features to get you into the Halloween spirit, including a Halloween movie suggester, a spooky story generator, and a section for Halloween history, recipes, and DIY decoration ideas.

## Features
Home: The landing page of the application that sets the mood with a Halloween theme.

Halloween Movie Suggester: This page uses The Movie Database (TMDB) API to suggest Halloween-themed movies based on user-selected genre and sorting options.

Spooky Story Generator: This page uses OpenAI's GPT-3 model to generate spooky stories based on a user-provided starting phrase and the chosen story style.

History/Recipes/DIY: This page provides a history of Halloween, along with recipes and DIY decoration ideas. It uses the Streamlit Session State feature to store user interactions across reruns of the application.
